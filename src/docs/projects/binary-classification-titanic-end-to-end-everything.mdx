## Introduction
Hello readers,
In this post we will cover up
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and gain insights on the factors that affected passenger survival,
- Perform Feature Engineering to create better features and improve our models,
- Built several Machine Learning models to predict whether a passenger survived the shipwreck.

## Libraries
We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting some parameters for the whole notebook (such as parameters for the plots, etc.). We will mainly use:

Pandas for handling and analysing data,
Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization, and
Scikit-learn for building Machine Learning models.

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('precision', 3)

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'

import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('darkgrid')

mpl.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 14
mpl.rcParams['axes.titlesize'] = 15
mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = 12
mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = 12
mpl.rcParams['legend.fontsize'] = 12

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler 
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, cross_val_predict, GridSearchCV

from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, VotingClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

print ('Libraries Loaded!')
```
```
Libraries Loaded!
```

## Getting the Data
The data has already been split into a training set ('train.csv') and a test set ('test.csv'). We can use the `read_csv()` method to load them as Pandas dataframes:

```python
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

print('Dataframes loaded!')
print('Training set: {} rows and {} columns'.format(train_df.shape[0], train_df.shape[1]))
print('Test set: {} rows and {} columns'.format(test_df.shape[0], test_df.shape[1]))
```
```
Dataframes loaded!

Training set: 891 rows and 12 columns
Test set: 418 rows and 11 columns
```

The training set is labeled, i.e. we know the outcome for each passenger, hence the difference in the number of columns.

We are going to merge the two dataframes into one. The new dataframe will have NaN in the 'Survived' column for instances of the test set:

```python
all_data = pd.concat([train_df, test_df])

print('Combined set: {} rows and {} columns'.format(all_data.shape[0], all_data.shape[1]))
print('\nSurvived?: ')
all_data['Survived'].value_counts(dropna = False)
```
```
Combined set: 1309 rows and 12 columns

Survived?: 
0.0    549
NaN    418
1.0    342
Name: Survived, dtype: int64
```

## A Quick Look at our Data
In this stage, we will temporarily forget the test set and focus on the training set.

We can take a look at the top five rows of the training set using the head() method:

[Download Dataset from here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

```python
train_df.head()
```
The meaning of each attribute is the following:

- PassengerId: the ID given to each passenger,
- Survived: the target attribute (1 for passengers who survived, 0 for those who didn't),
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd class),
- Name, Sex, Age: self-explanatory,
- SibSp: Number of siblings & spouses aboard the Titanic,
- Parch: Number of parents & children aboard the Titanic,
- Ticket: Ticket number,
- Fare: Passenger fare (in pounds),
- Cabin: Passenger's cabin number, and
- Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

'PassengerId' is unique to each passenger and can be dropped:

```python
train_df.drop('PassengerId', axis = 1, inplace = True)
```

The `info()` method can give us valuable information such as the type of each attribute and the number of missing values and obviously my favorite method:

```python
train_df.info()
```
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 891 entries, 0 to 890
Data columns (total 11 columns):
 #   Column    Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------    --------------  -----  
 0   Survived  891 non-null    int64  
 1   Pclass    891 non-null    int64  
 2   Name      891 non-null    object 
 3   Sex       891 non-null    object 
 4   Age       714 non-null    float64
 5   SibSp     891 non-null    int64  
 6   Parch     891 non-null    int64  
 7   Ticket    891 non-null    object 
 8   Fare      891 non-null    float64
 9   Cabin     204 non-null    object 
 10  Embarked  889 non-null    object 
dtypes: float64(2), int64(4), object(5)
memory usage: 76.7+ KB
```

The training set has 891 instances and 11 columns (10 attributes + the target attribute). 6 attributes are numerical, while 5 are categorical.

Let's take a closer look at the missing values:

```python
missing_counts = train_df.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending = False)
percent = (train_df.isnull().sum()*100/train_df.shape[0]).sort_values(ascending = False)

missing_df = pd.concat([missing_counts, percent], axis = 1, keys = ['Counts', '%'])
print('Missing values: ')
display(missing_df.head().style.background_gradient(cmap = 'Reds', axis = 0))
```
```
Missing values: 
----------Counts-------%
Cabin	   687	    77.104
Age	       177	    19.865
Embarked	2	    0.224
Fare	    0	    0.000
Ticket   	0	    0.000
```
Replacing missing values in the 'Age' and 'Embarked' columns won't be that difficult. We could use the median and the most frequent value as a replacement, respectively. However, we will probably have to discard the 'Cabin' attribute since more than 75% of all values are missing.

The `describe()` method gives us a statistical summary of the numerical attributes:

```python
train_df.describe()
```

```
--------Survived	Pclass	    Age	        SibSp	  Parch	    Fare
count	891.000 	891.000	    714.000	    891.000	  891.000	891.000
mean	0.384	    2.309	    29.699	    0.523	  0.382	    32.204
std	    0.487	    0.836	    14.526	    1.103	  0.806	    49.693
min	    0.000	    1.000	    0.420	    0.000	  0.000	    0.000
25%	    0.000	    2.000	    20.125	    0.000	  0.000	    7.910
50%	    0.000	    3.000	    28.000	    0.000	  0.000	    14.454
75%	    1.000	    3.000	    38.000	    1.000	  0.000	    31.000
max	    1.000	    3.000	    80.000	    8.000	  6.000	    512.329
```

The most important things to note are:

- Only 38% of passenger survived,
- The mean age is approximately 30 years old, while the median is 28 (therefore - it won't matter much which one we use for imputation),
- The median for both 'SibSp' and 'Parch' is 0 (most passengers were alone),
- The mean fare is £32.20, and
- These attributes have different scales, so we need to take care of that before feeding them to a Machine Learning algorithm.

We can quickly visualize the difference in scales, by plotting a histogram for each numerical attribute.


```python
num_atts = ['Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', 'Pclass']
train_df[num_atts].hist(figsize = (15, 6), color = 'steelblue', edgecolor = 'white', linewidth = 1.5, layout = (2, 3));
```

We can see that most of the passengers:

- were young (age < 40),
- boarded the ship alone (SibSp and Parch equal to 0),
- paid a low fare and boarded in the 3rd class.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Let's have a look at (almost) all attributes in greater detail.

### 1. Gender
```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (11, 4))

sns.countplot(x = 'Sex', hue = 'Survived', data = train_df,  palette = 'tab20', ax = ax1) 
ax1.set_title('Count of (non-)Survivors by Gender')
ax1.set_xlabel('Gender')
ax1.set_ylabel('Number of Passenger')
ax1.legend(labels = ['Deceased', 'Survived'])

sns.barplot(x = 'Sex', y = 'Survived', data = train_df,  palette = ['#94BFA7', '#FFC49B'], ci = None, ax = ax2)
ax2.set_title('Survival Rate by Gender')
ax2.set_xlabel('Gender')
ax2.set_ylabel('Survival Rate')
```
![img](https://i.imgur.com/Ya0USPn.png)

```python
pd.crosstab(train_df['Sex'], train_df['Survived'], normalize = 'index')
```
```
Survived	0	1
Sex		
female	0.258	0.742
male	0.811	0.189
```
There were more men than women on board. However, **more women survived** the shipwreck (the survival rate is almost 75% for women compared to only 20% for men!).

We can read in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic) that a "women and children first" protocol was implemented for boarding lifeboats. Therefore, apart from women, younger people had an advantage. With that in mind, let's see the age distribution.


### 2. Age
```python
men = train_df[train_df['Sex']  == 'male']
women = train_df[train_df['Sex']  == 'female']

fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize = (13, 4))

sns.distplot(train_df[train_df['Survived'] == 1]['Age'].dropna(), bins = 20, label = 'Survived', ax = ax1, kde = True)
sns.distplot(train_df[train_df['Survived'] == 0]['Age'].dropna(), bins = 20, label = 'Deceased', ax = ax1, kde = True)
ax1.legend()
ax1.set_title('Age Distribution - All Passengers')

sns.distplot(women[women['Survived'] == 1]['Age'].dropna(), bins = 20, label = 'Survived', ax = ax2, kde = True)
sns.distplot(women[women['Survived'] == 0]['Age'].dropna(), bins = 20, label = 'Deceased', ax = ax2, kde = True)
ax2.legend()
ax2.set_title('Age Distribution - Women')

sns.distplot(men[men['Survived'] == 1]['Age'].dropna(), bins = 20, label = 'Survived', ax = ax3, kde = True)
sns.distplot(men[men['Survived'] == 0]['Age'].dropna(), bins = 20, label = 'Deceased', ax = ax3, kde = True)
ax3.legend()
ax3.set_title('Age Distribution - Men')

plt.tight_layout()
```

![img](https://i.imgur.com/DGX7zH8.png)


It is evident that **different age group**s had very **different survival rates**. For instance, both genders display a higher probability of survival between the ages of 15 and 45. Also, the spike at young ages (0-4) shows that infants and young children have higher odds of survival.

Since survival seems to favour certain age groups, it might be useful to **bin** 'Age' before feeding it to an algorithm. We will pick an interval of 15 years.

```python
# train_df['Age_Bin'] = pd.qcut(train_df['Age'], 4)  # Quantile-based discretization
train_df['Age_Bin'] = (train_df['Age']//15)*15
train_df[['Age_Bin', 'Survived']].groupby(['Age_Bin']).mean()
```
```

--------Survived
Age_Bin	
0.0	    0.577
15.0	0.363
30.0	0.423
45.0	0.404
60.0	0.240
75.0	1.000
```
### 3. Port of Embarkation
```python
sns.countplot(x = 'Embarked', hue = 'Survived', data = train_df,  palette = 'tab20') 
plt.ylabel('Number of Passenger')
plt.title('Count of (non-)Survivors by Port of Embarkation')
plt.legend(['Deceased', 'Survived'])
```

![img](https://i.imgur.com/81eGZGr.png)

Most passengers embarked from Southampton, the port from which the ship started its voyage. It has by far the highest count for both survivors and non-survivors. Cherbourg has the second largest number of passengers and interestingly, more than half of them survived.

Looking at the data, I wasn't confident that this attribute would be useful. After all, the ship sank at the same point and at the same time for all passengers so it doesn't really matter where they embarked. However, I decided to test it anyway and observed that the performance of my models got worse when I included it, therefore we can **ignore it.**

### 4. Pclass
```python
print ('Number of passengers in each class:')
train_df['Pclass'].value_counts()
```
```
Number of passengers in each class:

3    491
1    216
2    184
Name: Pclass, dtype: int64
```

```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (12, 5))

sns.countplot(x = 'Pclass', hue = 'Survived', data = train_df,  palette = 'tab20', ax = ax1) 
ax1.legend(['Deceased', 'Survived'])
ax1.set_title('Count of (non-)Survivors by Class')
ax1.set_ylabel('Number of Passengers')

sns.barplot(x = 'Pclass', y = 'Survived', data = train_df,  palette = ['#C98BB9', '#F7D4BC', '#B5E2FA'], ci = None, ax = ax2)
ax2.set_title('Survival Rate by Class')
ax2.set_ylabel('Survival Rate')
```

![img](https://i.imgur.com/NZfyckI.png)

More than 50% of passengers boarded in the 3rd class. Nevertheless, **survival** favours the **wealthy** as shown in the right figure (the survival rate increases as we move from 3rd to 1st class).

### 5. Fare
One would assume that fare is closely related to class. Let's plot a boxplot for the distribution of Fare values across classes and a histogram for survival:

```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (12, 5))

sns.boxplot(x = 'Pclass', y = 'Fare', data = train_df, palette = 'tab20', ax = ax1)
ax1.set_title('Distribution of Fares by Class')

sns.distplot(train_df[train_df['Survived'] == 1]['Fare'], label = 'Survived', ax = ax2)
sns.distplot(train_df[train_df['Survived'] == 0]['Fare'], label = 'Not Survived', ax = ax2)
ax2.set_title('Distribution of Fares for (non-)Survivors')
ax2.set_xlim([-20, 200])
ax2.legend()
plt.show()
```
![img](https://i.imgur.com/zanMdrN.png)

It's not a surprise that people in class 1 paid more than the other two classes. As we already saw in the comparison of the classes, a **higher fare** leads to a **higher chance of survival.**

As with 'Age', we can benefit from **bining** the fare value. I prefer quantile-based discretization with 5 quantiles for this attribute.

```python
train_df['Fare_Bin'] = pd.qcut(train_df['Fare'], 5)
train_df[['Fare_Bin', 'Survived']].groupby(['Fare_Bin']).mean()
```
```

-------------------Survived
Fare_Bin

(-0.001, 7.854]	    0.218
(7.854, 10.5]	    0.201
(10.5, 21.679]	    0.424
(21.679, 39.688]	0.444
(39.688, 512.329]	0.642
```

### 6. SibSp and Parch
Someone could argue that having relatives could influence a passenger's odds of surviving. Let's test that:

```python
alone = train_df[(train_df['SibSp'] == 0) & (train_df['Parch'] == 0)]
not_alone = train_df[(train_df['SibSp'] != 0) | (train_df['Parch'] != 0)]
```
```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (12, 5))

sns.countplot(x = 'Survived', data = alone,  palette = 'tab20', ax = ax1) 
ax1.set_title('Count of Alone (non-)Survivors')
ax1.set_xlabel('')
ax1.set_xticklabels(['Deceased', 'Survived'])
ax1.set_ylabel('Number of Passengers')

sns.countplot(x = 'Survived', data = not_alone,  palette = 'tab20', ax = ax2) 
ax2.set_title('Count of (non-)Survivors with Family Onboard')
ax2.set_xlabel('')
ax2.set_xticklabels(['Deceased', 'Survived'])
ax2.set_ylabel('Number of Passengers')

plt.tight_layout()
```

![img](https://i.imgur.com/j30gkYm.png)

Having **relatives** on board **increases your chances of survival.**

Is the number of relative relevant? We can create a new attribute for the number of relatives on board and test that:

```python
train_df['Relatives'] = train_df['SibSp'] + train_df['Parch']
# train_df[['Relatives', 'Survived']].groupby(['Relatives']).mean()

sns.factorplot('Relatives', 'Survived', data = train_df, color = 'firebrick', aspect = 1.5)
plt.title('Survival rate by Number of Relatives Onboard')
plt.show()
```

![img](https://i.imgur.com/boI9QPz.png)

Having 1 to 3 relatives can actually increase you chances of survival.

### 7. Name/Title

Finally, we could see if a person's title (Mr, Miss etc.) plays a role in survival. I used Ken's code to extract the title for each instance. I then replaced rare titles with more common ones.
```python
train_df['Title'] = train_df['Name'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[1].split('.')[0].strip())

train_df['Title'].replace({'Mlle': 'Miss', 'Mme': 'Mrs', 'Ms': 'Miss'}, inplace = True)
train_df['Title'].replace(['Don', 'Rev', 'Dr', 'Major', 'Lady', 'Sir', 'Col', 'Capt', 'the Countess', 'Jonkheer'],
                           'Rare Title', inplace = True)
train_df['Title'].value_counts()
```
```
Mr            517
Miss          185
Mrs           126
Master         40
Rare Title     23
Name: Title, dtype: int64

```
```python
cols = ['#067BC2', '#84BCDA', '#ECC30B', '#F37748', '#D56062']
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (10, 4))

sns.countplot(x = 'Title', data = train_df,  palette = cols, ax = ax1)
ax1.set_title('Passenger Count by Title')
ax1.set_ylabel('Number of Passengers')

sns.barplot(x = 'Title', y = 'Survived', data = train_df,  palette = cols, ci = None, ax = ax2)
ax2.set_title('Survival Rate by Title')
ax2.set_ylabel('Survival Rate')
```

![img](https://i.imgur.com/iTaYpJW.png)

### 8. Others
We have already talked about the fact that women (Mrs or Miss) had higher odds of survival. What's really interesting is that Masters and people with a Rare Title have indeed a higher chance of survival compared to 'common' men (Mr).

1. **Cabin**

As we saw earlier, 3 out of 4 instances in the training set have a missing value for 'Cabin'. Additionally, it has a large number of unique values among the existing (non-NaN) values:
```python
print('Cabin:\n  Number of existing values: ', train_df['Cabin'].notnull().sum())
print('     Number of unique values: ', train_df['Cabin'].nunique())
```
```
Cabin:
  Number of existing values:  204
     Number of unique values:  147
```
Consequently, we can safely discard it. You can have a look at this notebook for more information about the 'Cabin' feature.

2. **Ticket/Family Survival**

We will indirectly use the 'Ticket' attribute to engineer a new feauture called 'Family_Survival'.
### 9. Summary
```

    PassengerId	            No        Discard

    Ticket                 Yes	      Engineer 'Family_Survival'
```

## Preparing Data
In this section, we will prepare the dataframe before we build any machine learning algorithm. We will use the combined dataframe so that both the train and the test set get processed at the same time. Another alternative would be to use pipilines.

Steps:

1. Replace missing values in 'Age' and 'Fare' with the corresponding median of the train set. Note that the test set has one missing value for 'Fare' (which we can easily check by calling `test_df.isnull().sum())`.

```python
all_data['Age'] = all_data['Age'].fillna(train_df['Age'].median())
all_data['Fare'] = all_data['Fare'].fillna(train_df['Fare'].median())
print('Done!')
```
```
Done!
```
2. Add the new attributes ('Family_Survival', 'Age_Bin', 'Fare_Bin', 'Relatives', 'Title).
```python
# Again, the code for 'Family_Survival' comes from this kernel:
# https://www.kaggle.com/konstantinmasich/titanic-0-82-0-83/notebook

all_data['Last_Name'] = all_data['Name'].apply(lambda x: str.split(x, ',')[0])
all_data['Fare'].fillna(all_data['Fare'].mean(), inplace = True)

default_sr_value = 0.5
all_data['Family_Survival'] = default_sr_value

for grp, grp_df in all_data[['Survived','Name', 'Last_Name', 'Fare', 'Ticket', 'PassengerId', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Age', 'Cabin']].groupby(['Last_Name', 'Fare']):
    
    if (len(grp_df) != 1):  # A Family group is found.
        for ind, row in grp_df.iterrows():
            smax = grp_df.drop(ind)['Survived'].max()
            smin = grp_df.drop(ind)['Survived'].min()
            passID = row['PassengerId']
            
            if (smax == 1.0):
                all_data.loc[all_data['PassengerId'] == passID, 'Family_Survival'] = 1
            elif (smin==0.0):
                all_data.loc[all_data['PassengerId'] == passID, 'Family_Survival'] = 0

for _, grp_df in all_data.groupby('Ticket'):
    
    if (len(grp_df) != 1):
        for ind, row in grp_df.iterrows():
            if (row['Family_Survival'] == 0) | (row['Family_Survival']== 0.5):
                smax = grp_df.drop(ind)['Survived'].max()
                smin = grp_df.drop(ind)['Survived'].min()
                passID = row['PassengerId']
                
                if (smax == 1.0):
                    all_data.loc[all_data['PassengerId'] == passID, 'Family_Survival'] = 1
                elif (smin==0.0):
                    all_data.loc[all_data['PassengerId'] == passID, 'Family_Survival'] = 0

```python
std_scaler = StandardScaler()

X_train_scaled = std_scaler.fit_transform(X_train)  # fit_transform the X_train
X_test_scaled = std_scaler.transform(X_test)        # only transform the X_test

- Only transform on train and test dataset.

## Building Machine Learning Models
### Baseline Models
The aim of this subsection is to calculate the **baseline performance** of 8 different estimators/classifiers on the training set. This will enable us to later see how tuning improves each of these models.

The classifiers are:

1. Gaussian Naive Bayes ,
2. Logistic Regression,
3. K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier,
4. Support Vector Classifier,
5. Decision Tree Classifier,
6. Random Forest Classifier,
7. Xtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier, and
8. AdaBoost classifier.

I won't go into detail about how these classifiers work. You can read more in this excellent book.

For the baseline models, we will use their **default parameters** and evaluate their (mean) accuracy by performing **k-fold cross validation**.

The idea behind k-fold cross validation, which is illustrated in the following figure, is simple: it splits the (training) set into k subsets/folds, trains the models using k-1 folds and evaluates the model on the remaining one fold. This process is repeated until every fold is tested once.

We can implement cross validation by using the `cross_val_score()` method from scikit-learn. We will use k = 5 folds. 

```python
random_state = 1

# Step 1: create a list containing all estimators with their default parameters
clf_list = [GaussianNB(), 
            LogisticRegression(random_state = random_state),
            KNeighborsClassifier(), 
            SVC(random_state = random_state, probability = True),
            DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = random_state), 
            RandomForestClassifier(random_state = random_state),
            XGBClassifier(random_state = random_state), 
            AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = random_state), random_state = random_state)]


# Step 2: calculate the cv mean and standard deviation for each one of them
cv_base_mean, cv_std = [], []
for clf in clf_list:  
    
    cv = cross_val_score(clf, X_train_scaled, y = y_train, scoring = 'accuracy', cv = 5, n_jobs = -1)
    
    cv_base_mean.append(cv.mean())
    cv_std.append(cv.std())

    
# Step 3: create a dataframe and plot the mean with error bars
cv_total = pd.DataFrame({'Algorithm': ['Gaussian Naive Bayes', 'Logistic Regression', 'k-Nearest Neighboors', 'SVC', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest', 'XGB Classifier', 'AdaBoost Classifier'],
                         'CV-Means': cv_base_mean, 
                         'CV-Errors': cv_std})

sns.barplot('CV-Means', 'Algorithm', data = cv_total, palette = 'Paired', orient = 'h', **{'xerr': cv_std})
plt.xlabel('Mean Accuracy')
plt.title('Cross Validation Scores')
plt.xlim([0.725, 0.88])
plt.axvline(x = 0.80, color = 'firebrick', linestyle = '--')
plt.show()
```

All estimators have a score **above 80%**, with SVC scoring the highest (85%).

We can combine the predictions of all these base classifiers and see if we get better predictive performance compared to each constituent individual classifier. This is the main motivation behind **Ensemble Learning**.

There are two options (see here and here):
1. **Hard Voting:** A hard voting classifier counts the votes of each estimator in the ensemble and picks the class that gets the most votes. In other words, the majority wins.
2. **Soft Voting:** Every individual classifier provides a probability value that a specific data point belongs to a particular target class. The predictions are weighted by the classifier's importance and summed up. Then the target label with the greatest sum of weighted probabilities wins the vote.

```python
estimators = [('gnb', clf_list[0]), ('lr', clf_list[1]),
              ('knn', clf_list[2]), ('svc', clf_list[3]),
              ('dt', clf_list[4]), ('rf', clf_list[5]),
              ('xgb', clf_list[6]), ('ada', clf_list[7])]

base_voting_hard = VotingClassifier(estimators = estimators , voting = 'hard')
base_voting_soft = VotingClassifier(estimators = estimators , voting = 'soft') 

cv_hard = cross_val_score(base_voting_hard, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv = 5)
cv_soft = cross_val_score(base_voting_soft, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv = 5)

print('Baseline Models - Ensemble\n--------------------------')
print('Hard Voting: {}%'.format(np.round(cv_hard.mean()*100, 1)))
print('Soft Voting: {}%'.format(np.round(cv_soft.mean()*100, 1)))
```
```
Baseline Models - Ensemble
--------------------------
Hard Voting: 84.9%
Soft Voting: 84.0%
```
The ensemble has indeed a higher (cv) score than most individual classifiers. We can also try dropping some classifiers and see if it improves more.
```python
base_voting_hard.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
base_voting_soft.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

y_pred_base_hard = base_voting_hard.predict(X_test_scaled)
y_pred_base_soft = base_voting_hard.predict(X_test_scaled)
```

## Model Tuning
We are ready to tune hyperparameters using grid search and see if performance improves. For more information about hyperparemeters, please visit the corresponding [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

```python
random_state = 1

cv_means_tuned = [np.nan] # we can't actually tune the GNB classifier, so we fill its element with NaN

#simple performance reporting function
def clf_performance(classifier, model_name):
    print(model_name)
    print('-------------------------------')
    print('   Best Score: ' + str(classifier.best_score_))
    print('   Best Parameters: ' + str(classifier.best_params_))
    
    cv_means_tuned.append(classifier.best_score_)
```

## Conclusions
This post came to an end! We can summarise it by mentioning a few points:

- EDA helped us understand where to focus. Factors such as a passenger's gender or/ and title showed that the initial assumption was actually true and even though 'there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others'.
- We should not rely completely on given feautures since we could benefit from engineering new ones.
- Building Machine Learning models requires a lot of tweaking of the parameter before we get a good/optimal result. Ensemble learning can usually help us towards this direction.
- Lastly, I would like to mention that looking at other people's work can give us new ideas and inspiration for our own project. Just make sure you give credit and don't copy a whole kernel.
