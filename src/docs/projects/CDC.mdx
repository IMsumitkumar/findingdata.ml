### 📑 Overview 

- This project is like a social media platform where we can talk to eachother in realtime.
- The main purpose of this project is to cluster all the user according to similiar domain(ex: web developement, data science, django framework etc.) so that experienced people in the perticular domain can contribute and help each other in `real time` ⌛.
- These rooms are predefined by the admin and the group is also managed by the admin.
- User's can leave the group anytime and can join one core room anytime.
- For now one user can only join group at a time.
- User's can make their own room and can chat in Realtime and anyone can join them.
- In core rooms, No one can **abuse**, insult or **hate anyone**🤫. If anyone abuses than bot will warn that user.
- In Core rooms, No one can **ask meta question** like below.
    ```
    1. Any user of $X here?
    2. Anyone used technology $y?
    3. whrer are you from ?
    ```
