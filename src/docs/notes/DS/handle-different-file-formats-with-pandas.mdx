## 🤔 what is pandas ?

![img](https://i.imgur.com/8iWzHrI.png)

pandas is the most powerful library for doing data manipulation and analysis out there.
pandas is like excel for python, with tables [which in padas are called `DataFrames` ,
and rows and columns [which in pandas called `Series`

## 📚 Working with various files format

If you know a little bit about data, we generally see .csv file format or .txt file format 
around us at the beginner level or even in kaggle like platform but at the industry level 
we have to deal with more complex dataset and type also. data can be in any file format like 
Binary file format or json format etc. so dealing with these file formats becomes a little bit though.

In this post, we will see how can we read and write a different type of file formats using pandas.

## 📥 Loading data

we will load all the basic and important file formats and will try to understand

### Env Setup and pandas Installation

It is a best practice to create a virtual environment and install the neccessary
packages inside the virtualenv.

**Create virtualenv using anaconda**

```bash title=python>3.6
conda create -n new_env python=3.7
conda activate new_env
```

**Install Pandas and jupyter notebook**
```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install pandas
```

## 🐼 Loading data with pandas

With pandas, we can load data having diffrent file formats.We will cover following

- .txt — text file
- .csv — comma seperated value
- .tsv — tab seperated value
- .html — hyper text markup language
- .json — javascript object notation
- Binary data format ( pickle, hd5 )
- Web APIs
- Database
- pdf

### From txt File

```python title=path-filename.txt
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("path_to_text_file", sep="")
```

### From csv file

```python title=python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("path_to_csv_file") # default par -> sep=","
```

### From Remote URL

```python title=python 
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("remote_url_path")

Eg : 
```
### From tsv File

```python title=python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("path_to_tsv_file", sep="\t")
```

### From HTML File

```python title=python highlight={4-6}
url = "http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2015_totals.html"
tables = pd.read_html(url)     

# List   
# Read data which is inside the tables. if more than one table then you can
# access using list operations.
```

### From Json Data

```python title=python
obj = """
    {"name": "Wes",
     "places_lived": ["United States", "Spain", "Germany"],
     "pet": null,
     "siblings": [{"name": "Scott", "age": 30,
                   "pets": ["Zeus", "Zuko"]},
                  {"name": "Katie", "age": 38,
                   "pets": ["Sixes", "Stache", "Cisco"]}]
    }
    """
import json
import pandas as pd
loaded = json.loads(obj)    # dict
json_data = json.dumps(loaded)  # str
siblings = pd.DataFrame(loaded['siblings'], columns=['name', 'age', 'pets';])

```

### Binary Data Format (pickle)

```python title=https://github.com/IMsumitkumar/Internshala-jobs-scrapping/blob/main/scrapped-dataset/DELHI.csv
import pandas as pd
pd.read_pickle('path_to_pkl_filr')
```

### From Web API

```python highlight={6-6} title=python
import requests
url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues'
resp = requests.get(url)
resp

# if resp -> <Response [200]> -> Accessable! Good to go

data = resp.json()
data[2]
```

let say i want to grab user data in 2nd issue

```python highlight={5-5} title=python
data = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data)
df = data['user'].apply(pd.Series)
type(df)

< pandas.core.frame.DataFrame >
```

### From DataBase

In order to read from Database, read the data from DB into a python
list and use `DataFrame()` to create one
```python title=python
import pandas as pd

db = # Create DB connection object 
cur = db.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM <TABLE>")
df = pd.DataFrame(cur.fetchall())

```


### from pdf

```python title=python

import tabula

# Read PDF into list of DataFrame
dataframe = tabula.read_pdf("input.pdf", pages='all')

# Convert PDF into CSV file
tabula.convert_into("input.pdf", "output.csv", output_format="csv", pages='all')

# Read remote PDF into list of DataFrame
dataframe_2 = tabula.read_pdf("https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java/raw/master/src/test/resources/technology/tabula/arabic.pdf")
```
