Files input/ouput is the basic and the important skill that a developer should have. If you want to do basic oeration with files or create scripts or diving into data
science, you must have that skill which is fortunately easy to implement.

In this post we will learn how to read and write file using python which makes these operation more easier.


### üìñ Opening Files

Before going to reading and writing files, first let‚Äôs know how to open files uisng `open()` function, which creates the file pointer stored in a variable in the memory.
 then we need to specify in which way we are planning to interact with the files.

There are four modes to interact with a file:

read(x) | write(x) | append(x) | create(x)

so, let‚Äôs look how we can open the file

`filename = 'file.ext'`

```python highlight={4-5} title=python
with open(filename, "r") as f:
   print(f)

OUTPUT:
# <_io.TextIOWrapper name='file.ext' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'>
```

first we assign the file in a variable called `filename` then we used `with` keyword which automatically close the pointer at the end of the block, with the `open()` function
to create a read file pointer with is referred as `f`.

OUTPUT is not the content of the files but rather the `pointer's information`


### üìÑ Reading Files

There are three methods to choose for reading file

1. `read()` : will return the entire file.
2. `readline()` : will return a single line .
3. `readlines()` : will return the entire file line by line .

```python title=python
with open(filename, "r") as f:
   print(f.read())                   # it will print the entire file
  
   lines = f.readlines()
   for line in lines:
      print(line)               # it will print line by line at time
```

### üìù Writing Files

There are two write methods

1. `write()` : If your goal is to write as if new, then use write (w) mode. This will erase any existing content in your file. If you want to preserve the current contents, then use 
append (a) mode and your new content will be written to the end of the file.
2. `writelines()` : it is similiar to readlines() from reading files.


```python title=python
one_line_string = "Hello World!"
multiline = ["Hello World!", "Write some code"]
with open(filename, "r") as f:
   f.write(one_line_string)
   f.writelines(multiline)

```
