## Data Transformation

Most of the time we need to transform our raw data.It may be incorrect datatypes or special characters in data columns or it can be anything.
So we will understand some basic data transformation which is must to move further and rest of them will be discussed later. 


### to_datetime : convert str columns to datetime

when we have date `time features` in our raw dataset, most of the time it is in string format and while keeping the column in 
string we can not filter out new features of date and time so we need to transform the string into `datetime` objects.

```python title=python highlight={3-4}
df = pd.DataFrame({'datetime':['21/11/2020', '22/11/2020', '23/11/2020']})   # object

pd.DataFrame(pd.to_datetime(df['datetime'], format="%d/%m/%Y"), columns=['datetime'])
```

In highlight line we simply converted pandas series into dataframe by `pd.DataFrame()`.


### astype : convert column datatype easily

`astype()` convert any column into desired datatype easily .

```python title=python highlight={3-4}
df = pd.DataFrame({'id': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']})

df['id'].astype('int64')

```

In this example, I have created a dataset of string(object) datatype and then converted into `int64` by `astype()` function.
it can be anything from `int64`  `float64`  `object`.

### apply : perform any operation on df or column

- `apply()` can be applied on single column as well as on entire dataframe.
- pandas allows us to easily perform to whole column of dataframe `example : df.col + 1` which adds 1 to all the values in column,
but sometime we have to do something unique that pandas doesn't support.In this case `apply()` function came into picture.
- when we use apply function, it is very common to use `lambda` functions along with it.
- In some special cases, the lambda function may not be enough. For example, we have a whole bunch of logic to apply to a column,
which can only be put in a customised function. So, the apply() function can also be used along with customised functions.we just need to pass the 
functions inside `apply(foo)`.

```python title=On-Single-Column highlight={3-4}
df = pd.DataFrame({'number': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})

df.number.apply(lambda n: n+1)
```

```python title=On-Entire-DataFrame highlight={4-5}
df = pd.DataFrame({'num1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
                   'num2': [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]})

df.apply(lambda row: row['num1'] + row['num2'], axis=1)
```

```python title=Passing-Function-in-Apply highlight={4-5}
def sum_cols(row):
    return row['num1'] + row['num2']

df.apply(sum_cols, axis=1)
```

### explode : convert each element of list into row

I used to use this function when dealing with JSON documents. Because of the style of JSON, sometimes we have one key with an array value. In this case,
 we can easily flatten the array.
 
```python title=Custom-DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame([{
    'name': 'Chris', 
    'languages': ['Python', 'Java']
},{
    'name': 'Jade',
    'languages': ['Java', 'Javascript']
}])
```

In this example, the languages that directly loaded from a JSON document are still arrays. Then, letâ€™s use df.explode() function to flatten it out.

```python title=python
df.explode('languages')

```

> Well, the Pandas library of Python has a lot more functions that makes it such a flexible and powerful data analytics tool in Python. In this post, I just organised the basic ones for data transformation that I believe are the most useful.
