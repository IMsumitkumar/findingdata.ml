## Data Cleansing

Before reading this post, i would suggest you to read [Data Preview](/notes/DS/important-functions-of-pandas-data-preview/) first.

We have covered about pandas,  pandas dataframe, pandas series and most common functions of data preview that pandas provides in out previous posts.

It is quite common that the raw dataset we got is not perfect. So always need to clean our dataset before use. Here are some related functions that pandas have 

## We will work on same [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv) 

### isna : filter NULL values from the dataframe

- `isna()` returns a series of boolean values representing whether the `Column record` is NULL or not.

```
df.isna()
```

- `isna().sum()` returns sum count of Null values present in each column. So u can get a rought idea about how many values are Null.

```
df.isna().sum()
```

as we can see `Sex` column have 177 NuLL values. let's drop them 

- We can drop all the rows having NULL values 

```python title=python
df=df[~df['Sex'].isna()]                        

df.shape  # (714, 12)
```

- `~` sign at the beginning reversed the boolean value, since we want to reserve the rows that NOT having NULL values. Finally, the data frame df
will be filtered by this boolean series, where the row with “False” boolean value will be discarded.

Remember our dataset shape was `891x12` and now it is `714x12`.

### dropna : drop null values from entire dataset

- if we want to drop null values from entire dataset. we can use dropna() function. 
- `dropna()` filter all the rows having at least one null values. we can set the threshold for number of null values.
- we can use `isna()` method but we will need to repeat  many  times for every column.
- It is not a good idea to drop all the null values when there is a lot of null values according to our data.

```python
df = df.dropna()
df.isna().sum()
```

### fillna : fill null values

- `fillna()` fills the null values something that we will provide.
- In this example, we will fill null values with `Missing` string.

```
df.fillna()
``` 

### drop_duplicates : drop duplicates rows

- Sometimes the raw dataset may have some duplicated rows which we don't want.

```python title=python highlight={6-7}
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "id":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
    "Name":['sumit', 'lalit', 'bob', 'vineet', 'pankaj', 'mehek', 'sumit']
})

df.drop_duplicates()
```

In this example dataframe, `sumit` occurs two times so `drop_duplicates` will drop one `sumit`


### drop : drop a list of columns

- Suppose we want to some some columns that we dont want like `_Id` or the column that almost have all the null values, drop() will do it.
- we can pass a list of multiple columns if we want to drop more than one column.
- This function can be used to drop rows. 

```python title=python highlight={6-7}
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "id":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
    "Name":['sumit', 'lalit', 'bob', 'vineet', 'pankaj', 'mehek', 'sumit']
})

df.drop(columns=['id'], axis=1) # axis=1 : drop column wise

```

### rename : rename all the column names

- `rename()` helped us to rename the columns headers.
- Note : rename takes a dictionary as the parameter to map the columns.where keys are the old headers and values are the new headers.

``` python title=python highlight={6-7}
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "id":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
    "Name":['sumit', 'lalit', 'bob', 'vineet', 'pankaj', 'mehek', 'sumit']
})

df.rename(columns={'id':'_id', 'Name':'Full_Name'})
```

### reset_index : reset indexes 

When we drop some rows that having null values then indexes are also reseted because some rows were deleted in the middle. So to reset the indexes `reset_index` function is used.

```mdx  
df.reset_index()
```
> Indeed, the Pandas library of Python has a lot more functions that makes it such a flexible and powerful data analytics tool in Python. In this post, I just organised the basic ones for data cleansing that I believe are the most useful.
