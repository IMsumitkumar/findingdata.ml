Before reading this, I suggest you read the previous post [Intro and data I/O with pandas](/notes/DS/pandas/)

As one of the most powerful python library for data manipulation, pandas is a **must learn** library for data I/O, data manipulation, data cleaning, 
data transformation, data aggregation and a lot and yes pandas is open source.

In this post, I haven't covered all the functions that pandas provide but some of them which frequently used by us while dealing with data 
So what are we waiting for. let's see one by one

## Notation

```
df      <--> dataframe
columns <--> features
rows    <--> records
```

## Create DataFrame

DataFrame is a data structure of pandas. If your data is typeof dataframe then u can apply all the functions that pandas provides.

```python title=padas-python
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "id":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
    "Name":['sumit', 'lalit', 'bob', 'vineet', 'pankaj', 'mehek', 'kajal']
})
df
```

## Load the dataset 

Download Dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)

```python highlight={2-3}
import pandas as pd    
df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")
```

## Data preview

Before working on a problem we often want to know how is our problem look like what is the problem. Similiarly while woorking with datasets
we want to get the general picture of our dataset we have, or whether our dataset is loaded into pandas dataframe or not. to do such, we will need
to know some functions...

### head : preview the first n (default=5)

`head` shows top n records from your dataset. well `n=5` is default but you can always specify how many rows to show as `df.head(10)` to show top 10 records.
```
 df.head()
```

### tail : preview the last n (default=5)

`tail` is similiar to head `tail` shows last n records from the dataset. you can specify how many rows to show as `df.tail(10)` to show last 10 records.If you
 didn't specify anything then it will show last 5 records by default.

```
df.tail()
```

### info : display basic info of data

`info` display all the basic information of your dataframe like 
- data types of each feature
- shape of DataFrame 
- Non Null Count for each feature
- memory usage

```
df.info()
```

### sort values : Sort a specific column

`sort_values` function will sort given column based on the data it have in ascending or descending order.
- If column have text data then it will arrange in alphabetical order or if it have number than it will sort according to natural numbers.
- `inplace` is set to be `true` if you want to assign  the sorted  data frame back to your variable. Otherwise your `dataframe` will not be changed.

```python
df.sort_values(by='Name', ascending=True, inplace=True)
```

### columns : display all the columns

`columns` is a dataframe property not a function which display all the columns(features) that your dataframe have.

```
df.columns
```

### dtypes : display datatypes of columns

`dtypes` is a dataframe property not a function which display datatypes of each feature. It is very helpful when you want to check datatypes
for all the columns(features).

```
df.dtypes
```

### shape : display the shape of dataframe

`shape` is also not a function, It is a property of dataframe which display count of all rows and columns in `(R, C)` format.
where `R` refers to totoal number of rows (records) and `C` refers to number of columns (features).

```python 
df.shape
```

### describe : show basic stats of each column
 
`describe()` display all the basic stats for each numerical feature.It basically gives you the basic picture of data distribution.

It ignores Categorical and other features, it only considers numerical features.

```
df.describe()
```

### value counts : Count occurance of each column

- `value_counts()` function applies on a pandas series rather than a pandas dataframe or we can say for a single column.    
- It counts the occurance of each value in the series whether numerical or Categorical.

```
df.Sex.value_counts()
```

### unique : display each Category from column 

`unique()` display all the unique Categories of singe column. It is good to apply when there is a categorical feature, to see whether can one handle it by creating
a simple dictionary and mapping dictionary or not (we will discuss it later).

```python title=python
df['Sex'].unique()
```

### select datatypes : seperate datatypes

Sometimes you need to work based on numerical, categorical, and datetime datatypes seperatly so that you can handle them individually so you can 
simply seperate all the different types of features by `select_dtypes`. `include` takes a `list of datatypes` inside `select_dtypes` as an argument.

```python  title=python 
num = df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns
cat = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
dt = df.select_dtypes(include=['datetime64[ns]']).columns

print("Numerical Columns :",num)
print("Categorical Columns :",cat)
print("datetime Columns :",dt)
```

> Indeed, the Pandas library of Python has a lot more functions that makes it such a flexible and powerful data analytics tool in Python. In this post, I just organised the basic ones that I believe are the most useful.
