- A measure of central tendency is a summary statistic that represents the center point or typical value of a dataset.
- In other words, it is a central location of a dataset.
- the measure indicates where most values in a distribution falls.
- the three most common central tendency are **mean** **median** **mode**.

### Mean

- Mean is average of all the data points also called as arthmetic mean.
- To calculate mean, just add all the data points and divide by the count of numbers.

```mdx title=Mean highlight={3-4}
datapoints = [5,2,4,1,7,8,3]

x(bar) = (5+2+4+1+7+8+3) / 7 = 4.28
```

### Median   

- Median is a middle value in a sorted datapoints.
- We prefer median when we have outliers or skewed data because median are less prone to outliers.
- To calculate median, first - sort the datapoints in ascending ot descending order and pick the middle value.

```mdx title=Odd highlight={3-5}
datapoints = [5,2,4,1,7,8,3]

sorted = [1,2,3,(4),5,7,8]
median = 4
```

```mdx title=Even highlight={3-5}
datapoints = [20,10,35,25,50,40]

sorted = [10,20,(25,35),40,50]
median = (25+35)/2 = 30  
```

### Mode 

- Mode is the value which occurs the most frequently in dataset.
- In bar chart, Mode is the highest length bar.
- If your data have multiple values that occuring frequrently, you have a multimodal distribution.
- If no data repeats, then your data do not have a mode.

```mdx title=Mode highlight={3-5}
datapoints = [10,20,25,50,35,40,40,40,40]

occurance of 40 is 4

Mode = 40
```
