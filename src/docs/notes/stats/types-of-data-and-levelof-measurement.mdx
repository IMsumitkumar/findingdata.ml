## Types of Data

generally, there are two types of data 

1. **Categorical Data**
    - Nominal data
    - Ordinal data

2. **Numerical Data**
    - Discrete data
    - Continuous data

## Categorical Data

- Categorical data represents groups or categories.
- qualitative data classified into categories.
- there are two type of data lie under categorical data

### Ordinal Data

- So, when we talk about Nominal data its directly mean **data with an Order** associated with it.

```
Low < Medium < High
```

### Nominal Data

- Nominal data means **no order** associated with the data.
```
1. Yes or No
2. BMW, Audi, Ferrari etc
```

## Numerical Data

- Data Expressed with **digits** and can be measurable.

```
1. Height
2. Price
3. blood pressure
etc ...
```

### Descrete Data
- Descrete data represents items that can be counted.
- Data that is descrete from one another having a quite of range between them.

```
1. 0,1,2,3
2. 100,200,300,301
```

### Continuous Data

- Continuous Data represents measurements; their possible number can not be counted and ccan only be described using intervals on real number line.

```
1. 8.0, 8.1, 8.33, 8.3456, 8.8979, 9.0231
```


## Level of measurement

| Level of measurement|
|----------------|-------------|
|**qualitative** | **Quantative**|
|Nominal|Interval|
|Ordinal|Ratio|
