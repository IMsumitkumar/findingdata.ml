Before heading to probability density function or cumulative density function, we will understand about random variables because these density function
works on different type of random variables

## Random Variables

- Random variables are the values which are depend upon the outcome of any experiment.
- for example, while rolling a dice, we dont know what is the outcome (it may be any one from 1,2,3,4,5,6) so variable value depend upon the outcome of experiment.

random variables are of two types:
1. Continuous random variables
2. Discrete random variable

### Continuous random variables

- The variables which having the values between a range or interval and we can grab infinite number of values from that interval.
- for example : weight of 100 random people.

### Discrete random values

- The variables whose values are obtained by the counting.
- for example : Number of student present in a class.

## probability Mass Function (PMF)

> probability density function is a statistical term that describes the probability distribution on Discrete random variables.


## probability Density Function (PDF)

> probability density function is a statistical term that describes the probability distribution of Continuous random variables.

- If datapoints of given dataset follows gaussian distribution then Pdf will also follow probability density function.
- On pdf, the probability of single outcome will always be zero because single point represent the line which doesn't cover any area under the curve.

Mostly PDF follows Normal Distribution (Bell like Curve)

[Download Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)

```python title=PDF 
counts, bin_edges = np.histogram(iris_data['PetalLengthCm'], bins=10, 
                                 density = True)

pdf = counts / sum(counts)
```

## Cumulative density function (CDF)

As we know PDF describes probability distribution for Continuous random variables and PMF describes probability distribution for Discrete random variables.

> Cumulative density function is a statistical term that describes the probability distribution for Continuous as well as Discrete ramdom variables.

For example, if X is the height of a person selected at random then F(x) is the chance that the person will be shorter than x. If F(180 cm)=0.8. then there is
an 80% chance that a person selected at random will be shorter than 180 cm (equivalently, a 20% chance that they will be taller than 180cm).

```python title=CDF
cdf = np.cumsum(pdf)
```

## Visuals 

```python 
counts, bin_edges = np.histogram(iris_data['PetalLengthCm'], bins=10, 
                                 density = True)

pdf = counts/(sum(counts))
cdf = np.cumsum(pdf)

plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf)
plt.plot(bin_edges[1:], cdf)
plt.gca().legend(('Pdf','Cdf'))

plt.title('PDF and CDF For iris_setosa')
plt.xlabel("Petal length")
plt.ylabel("Percentage")
plt.show()
```
