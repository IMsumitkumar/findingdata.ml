## Covariance 
- covariance is a method to find out the variance between two variables.
- To be more specific, covariance compares two variables in terms of the deviations from their mean (or expected) value.
- It is a relationship between pair of random variables where change in one variables cause change in other variable.
- It can take any value between -infinity to +infinity, where the negative value represents the negative relationship whereas a positive value represents the positive relationship.
- It is used for the linear relationship between variables.
- It has dimensions.

Consider the random variables “X” and “Y”. Some realizations of these variables are shown in the figure below.

### Positive covariance
The orange dot show the mean of X and mean of Y. As the values of a get away from the mean of X in positive direction, the values of Y tend to change in similar way. Same relation is valid for negative direction as well.

The formula for covariance of two random variables:

If X and Y change in the same direction, as in the figure above, covariance is positive. Let’s confirm with the covariance function of numpy:

np.cov() returns the covariance matrix. The covariance of X and Y is 0.11. The value at position [0,0] shows the covariance of X with itself and the value at [1,1] shows the covariance of Y with itself. If you run the code np.cov(X,X), you will get the value at position [0,0] which is 0.07707877 in this case. Similarly, np.cov(Y,Y) will return the value at position [1,1].

The covariance of a variable with itself is actually indicates the variance of that variable:

```
Covariance(X, X) = Variance(X)
```

## Correlation

- It shows whether and how strongly pair of variables related to each other.
- Correlation takes values between -1 to +1 and correlation near to +1 means highly correlated and vice versa.
- It is a scaled version of covariance.
- It is dimensionless.

### Negative, Positive , no correlation

- Positive : When all the values of variables deviate in positive direction.
- Negative : When all the values of variables deviate in Negative direction.
- zero/no : when two variables are independent from each other.
